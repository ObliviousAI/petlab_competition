We will introduce the second script, `.\/start-oblv.sh`, in the next subsection.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the installation script, first open a terminal. To do this, on the top panel on this window click `Tools >> Terminal`.

    "Now that we've installed proxy, we can connect to the enclave. Now, to make a connection you both authenticate yourself **and** the attestation of the enclave. To do this, the `oblv` cli proxy needs access to your public\/private key pair which you were emailed (or will be, depending on when you are reading this). \n",

    "These keys should have been labelled `oblv_public.der` and `oblv_private.der` and the keys the contents will be unique for you. If you look at the sidebar on the left, and click the paper clip icon, you can upload those keys as files to the `\/data\/notebook_files\/`. In principle, it doesn't matter what you call these files, but we've hardcoded `oblv_public.der` and `oblv_private.der` into the script `.\/start-oblv.sh` for your convenience. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: The `.\/start-oblv.sh` script is only a template for you to fill in based on the details you received in an email from the organisers. You will have to copy in the PCR codes (there are 3 of these) and the URL hosting the enclave. The script is a single command and there is no reason at all this needs to be a script and not run directly - however, in testing we found some people had issues pasting into the Datalore terminal in the web console, so we put it into a script to make life easier for you. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the keys are in place, go ahead and hit `.\/start-oblv.sh` in the terminal. This will run the proxy to listen to port 3031 and forward it securely end-to-end into the enclave. Encryption is performed on the fly, so you can just send requests to `localhost:3031` an interact with the enclave as if it is running in locally. "

By really understanding `train_x` via visualization, dimensionality reduction, etc you can hopefully make more informed queries, spending less epsilon and delta. Equally, when you get an output, for example, some synthetic data, then you have the opportunity to figure out how to use that output to make informed predictions on `test_x`. "
